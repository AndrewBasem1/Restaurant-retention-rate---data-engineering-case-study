    "While the size of the dataset for this exercise can easily fit in memory and all analysis code be done by simple pandas DataFrames, this notebook shows a different approach. One that's scalabale by doing the following:\n",
    "1. Utilizing a SQL database to host the data and transform it as needed all using SQL.\n",
    "2. Instead of reading the csv files from the zip file directly all at once, we're using an iterator that will read lines one at a time. thus we can read them in batches, send the batches to the SQL database, and move on to the next batch (this becomes relevant for when data is larger than available memory).\n",
